= Interoperability Matrix
:spec-version: 0.1.0
:status: draft
:last-updated: 2024-12-28

== Overview

This document tracks interoperability between implementations of the Verified Container Specification. The matrix is automatically updated by CI when implementations run conformance tests.

== Implementation Status

Legend:

* ✓ = Conformant
* ○ = Partial
* ✗ = Non-conformant
* - = Not tested

== Cross-Implementation Testing

=== Producer → Consumer Compatibility

Bundles created by producers should be verifiable by consumers.

== Adding Your Implementation

To add your implementation to the interop matrix:

1. Implement the CLI contract defined in `conformance/runner/cli-contract.json`
2. Run conformance tests: `just conformance-run --profile <producer|consumer> --impl ./your-impl`
3. Submit results via PR to this repository

== Conformance Badges

Implementations can display conformance badges:

```markdown
![Basic Conformance](https://verified-container.org/badges/basic.svg)
![Moderate Conformance](https://verified-container.org/badges/moderate.svg)
![Full Conformance](https://verified-container.org/badges/full.svg)
```

== Changelog
