== Overview

This glossary defines terms used throughout the Verified Container Specification. Terms are used consistently across all specification documents.

== Terms

[[attestation]]
Attestation::
A signed statement about a software artifact, following the https://github.com/in-toto/attestation[in-toto Attestation Framework]. Attestations are cryptographically bound to their subjects.

[[attestation-bundle]]
Attestation Bundle::
A packaged collection of attestations with transparency log inclusion proofs. Defined in link:../spec/attestation-bundle.adoc[Attestation Bundle Format].

[[builder]]
Builder::
A system that constructs container images from source materials. Builders sign build provenance attestations.

[[consumer]]
Consumer::
A system that verifies and executes container images. Consumers validate attestation bundles before allowing execution. Examples: Svalinn, Vordr.

[[dsse]]
DSSE (Dead Simple Signing Envelope)::
A signature envelope format defined by https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/dsse[secure-systems-lab]. Used to wrap attestations with cryptographic signatures.

[[ed25519]]
Ed25519::
An elliptic curve digital signature algorithm defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032[RFC 8032]. The mandatory signature algorithm for this specification.

[[frost]]
FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)::
A threshold signature scheme. FROST-Ed25519 is used for k-of-n signing in threshold groups.

[[inclusion-proof]]
Inclusion Proof::
A Merkle tree proof demonstrating that an entry exists in a transparency log at a specific index.

[[in-toto]]
in-toto::
A framework for securing software supply chains through attestations. See https://in-toto.io/[in-toto.io].

[[log-operator]]
Log Operator::
An organization that operates a transparency log instance. At least 3 independent operators are required for federation.

[[merkle-tree]]
Merkle Tree::
A hash tree structure where each leaf is a hash of data, and each non-leaf is a hash of its children. Used in transparency logs for efficient proofs.

[[oci]]
OCI (Open Container Initiative)::
A governance structure for container format and runtime specifications. See https://opencontainers.org/[opencontainers.org].

[[oci-referrers-api]]
OCI Referrers API::
An OCI specification for discovering artifacts related to container images. Used to distribute attestation bundles.

[[predicate]]
Predicate::
The typed content of an attestation, describing specific properties (provenance, SBOM, etc.).

[[producer]]
Producer::
A system that creates verified container artifacts, including images and attestation bundles. Examples: Cerro Torre.

[[provenance]]
Provenance::
A record of how a software artifact was created, including source materials, build process, and environment. See https://slsa.dev/provenance[SLSA Provenance].

[[quorum]]
Quorum::
The minimum number of participants required for an action. This specification requires 2-of-3 log operator quorum.

[[revocation]]
Revocation::
The act of invalidating a key or attestation, recorded in the transparency log.

[[sbom]]
SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)::
An inventory of software components in an artifact. This specification uses https://spdx.dev/[SPDX 2.3] format.

[[signed-tree-head]]
Signed Tree Head (STH)::
A cryptographically signed snapshot of a transparency log's current state, including tree size and root hash.

[[slsa]]
SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts)::
A security framework for software supply chains. See https://slsa.dev/[slsa.dev]. This specification requires SLSA Provenance v1.

[[subject]]
Subject::
The software artifact that an attestation describes. Identified by content-addressable digest.

[[threshold-signature]]
Threshold Signature::
A signature scheme requiring k-of-n participants to create a valid signature. Used for release signing.

[[transparency-log]]
Transparency Log::
An append-only, cryptographically verifiable log of attestations. Multiple independent logs provide federation.

[[trust-store]]
Trust Store::
A collection of public keys and policies used to verify attestation bundles. Defined in link:../spec/trust-store.adoc[Trust Store Format].

[[verification]]
Verification::
The process of validating an attestation bundle against a trust store, including signature verification, log proof validation, and threshold checking.

[[verification-mode]]
Verification Mode::
The strictness level for verification: Strict (fail on any error), Permissive (warn only), or Audit (log only).
