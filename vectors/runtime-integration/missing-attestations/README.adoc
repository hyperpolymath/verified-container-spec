= missing-attestations

== Description

Valid .ctp bundle structure but missing the `attestations/` directory entirely.

== Expected Behavior

* **Strict mode**: REJECT with MISSING_ATTESTATION (exit 1)
* **Permissive mode**: WARN but continue (exit 0)
* **Audit mode**: LOG only (exit 0)

== Validates

* Attestation requirement enforcement (verification-protocol.adoc Section 6.2)
* Verification mode handling
* Graceful degradation in permissive mode

== Reference

See verification-protocol.adoc Section 6.2:

> If no bundle found:
>   - Strict mode: REJECT with `MISSING_ATTESTATION`
>   - Permissive mode: WARN and continue without verification
