= Trust Store Format
:spec-version: 0.1.0
:status: draft
:media-type: application/vnd.verified-container.trust-store+json

== 1. Scope

This document defines the format for trust stores in the Verified Container Specification. It covers:

* The structure and required fields of a trust store
* Key management and role-based key organization
* Threshold signature group definitions
* Transparency log operator registration
* Trust store update procedures

This document does NOT cover:

* Attestation bundle format (see link:attestation-bundle.adoc[Attestation Bundle Format])
* Verification procedures (see link:verification-protocol.adoc[Verification Protocol])
* Transparency log operation (see link:transparency-log.adoc[Transparency Log Requirements])

== 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

See link:../docs/glossary.adoc[Glossary] for definitions of terms used throughout this specification.

== 3. Overview

A trust store contains public keys and policies for verifying attestation bundles. Both producers and consumers maintain trust stores, which may have overlapping content but are independently managed.

== 4. Media Type

```
application/vnd.verified-container.trust-store+json
```

  "keys": { /* keyed by role */ },
  "thresholds": { /* threshold groups */ },
  "logs": { /* transparency log operators */ }
}
```

    }
  }
}
```

== 7. Trust Store Updates

=== 7.1 Update Format

Trust store updates are distributed as signed documents:

```json
{
  "payloadType": "application/vnd.verified-container.trust-store+json",
  "payload": "<base64-encoded-trust-store>",
  "signatures": [
    {
      "keyid": "sha256:...",
      "sig": "<base64-encoded-signature>"
    }
  ]
}
```

=== 7.2 Update Requirements

1. Updates MUST be signed by a key in the `trust-store-updaters` role
2. The `version` field MUST be greater than the current version
3. The `updated` timestamp MUST be later than the current timestamp
4. Key removals SHOULD include a grace period for propagation

=== 7.3 Key Rotation

When rotating keys:

1. Add new key with future `validFrom` date
2. Distribute update
3. Wait for propagation (recommended: 7 days)
4. Begin using new key
5. Set `validUntil` on old key
6. Distribute update
7. After `validUntil` passes, remove old key

== 8. Minimum Requirements

A compliant trust store MUST contain:

* At least 1 key in `builders` role
* At least 1 threshold group in `thresholds`
* At least 3 log operators in `logs` (for 2-of-3 quorum)

== 10. Security Considerations

=== 10.1 Trust Store Distribution

Trust stores SHOULD be distributed via:
* HTTPS with certificate pinning
* Signed Git commits
* Out-of-band verification (checksums on website)

Trust stores SHOULD NOT be fetched from:
* The same registry as the images being verified
* Unauthenticated channels

=== 10.2 Offline Operation

Systems operating offline MUST have a pre-loaded trust store. The `validUntil` fields allow graceful degradation when updates cannot be fetched.

=== 10.3 Compromise Recovery

If a key is compromised:

1. Publish trust store update removing the compromised key
2. Revoke any attestations signed by that key (log revocation entries)
3. Re-sign affected packages with remaining valid keys
4. If threshold group compromised (k keys), rotate entire group
